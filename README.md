# abundances_C-O
This code simulates the abundance of molecules in a hot atmosphere, dominated by hydrogen.  This code creates graphs similar to those presented in the paper "Carbon dioxide in exoplanetary atmospheres: Rarely dominant compared to carbon monoxide and water in hot atmospheres dominated by hydrogen" by Kevin Heng et al.
